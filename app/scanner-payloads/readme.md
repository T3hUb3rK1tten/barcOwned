# Payloads Directory

[View Payload Docs](../docs/payloads)

To define custom payloads, create a new JSON file in this directory.

Then, crate a `manifest.json` containing an array of all payloads you would like barcOwned to load.

For an example, see `manifest.example.json`, which includes the default sample payloads.
