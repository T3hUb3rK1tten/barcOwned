# Setup Scripts Directory

[View Setup Script Docs](../docs/setup-scripts)

To define custom setup scripts, create a new JSON file in this directory.

Then, crate a `manifest.json` containing an array of all scripts you would like barcOwned to load.

For an example, see `manifest.example.json`, which includes the default sample scripts.
