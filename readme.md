**"Like a Rubber Ducky for barcode scanners"**

The simple looking barcode scanner used in virtually every industry that touches a computer actually has a surprising amount of features and complexity. Using esoteric programming barcodes, one can instruct a scanner to type special keys and gain keyboard-like access to a machine.

This tool, barcOwned (pronounced "barc-owned" or "bar-coned") provides a simple web tool to program a barcode scanner with certain rules, or "setup scripts", that can be used to deliver a payload. The tool is easy to customize, after the dirty work of adding a scanner is complete, scripts can be customized rapidly to achieve the desired payload.
